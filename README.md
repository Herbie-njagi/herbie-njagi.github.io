# Muraga Technical Training Institute Website

Website and student portals for **Muraga Technical Training Institute (MTTI)** - *Innovation & Excellence*.

## What is in this repository

| Path | Description |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | The website (home, about, courses, apply, news, gallery, management, contact) and the portals |
| `assets/styles.css` | Styles |
| `assets/app.js` | Site logic, admin panel, portals, Excel and PDF tools |

## Features

- Multi-page layout with hero slider, dropdown menu and animations
- Courses by department and campus (Main Campus and Kaare Campus), Level 4-6 with KCSE entry requirements
- Online application form with a downloadable PDF application slip
- Admin panel: courses, announcements, gallery, management, testimonials, vision and mission, values, fee structure, contacts, social links
- Role-based portals: **Admin**, **Admissions**, **Trainer**, **Student**
- Trainers publish results (single entry or Excel upload) with competency levels: Mastery, Proficient, Competent, Not Yet Competent
- Admissions can import enrolled students from Excel and record fee payments
- Student results and fees are end-to-end encrypted; students view them with their admission number

## Important: where the portals run

The portals, admin panel and database features were built for the **claude.ai artifact runtime** (`window.claude` database, file storage, sign-in and downloads). 

- **On GitHub Pages or any plain web host, the public pages display, but the admin panel and portals show as unavailable and nothing can be saved.**
- To run the full system on your own hosting you need a backend with real sign-in and a database (for example Firebase or Supabase) and the data calls in `assets/app.js` replaced with it. The encryption code (`mkKeys`, `seal`, `unseal`) is plain Web Crypto and can be reused as is.
